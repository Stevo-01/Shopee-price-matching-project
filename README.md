# Shopee-price-matching-project

### Objective
The Objective is to determine whether two products are the same by their images and texts or not. Therefore, we need to implement a combination of deep learning and traditional machine learning for analysing image and text information to compare similarity.

### Dataset
Shopee Dataset from  **[kaggle](https://kaggle.com)** Shopee is the leading e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia and Taiwan

### Approach
* Data Collection
* Data Preprocessing & Cleaning 
* Feature Extraction 
  * TF-IDF 
  * Pre-train CNN 
* Modelling 
  * Text Analysis Model using 
    * Cosine Distance 
  * Image Analysis Model using
    * K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
